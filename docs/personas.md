# Personas â†’ build empathy!

Concept from book **Inmates are Running the Asylum** *by Alan Cooper*, first published in 1999. He coined the term â€˜elastic userâ€™ to demonstrate the idea of a user â€˜who must bend and stretchâ€™ to adapt to the needs of the moment, rather than what they themselves, require. â†’ instead, bend and stretch and adapt to the needs of the user! (https://www.sage.com/en-gb/blog/creating-user-personas-to-improve-accessibility/)



*Accessibility Personas represent the segment of differently abled users that will be using our product/service and are created keeping their accessibility needs in mind.* (https://medium.com/@sanchita.sri/accessibility-personas-51433d886841)



Kann man wirklich behaupten, dass 1 von 5 (oder 4) Personen eine **fÃ¼r digitale Barrierefreiheit relevante** Behinderung hat? Jemand ohne Beine ist ja schliesslich nicht betroffen...



ðŸ¤” Soll ich generell "they" schreiben?!



Warum nicht einfach neuer Terminus "diffabled" einfÃ¼hren fÃ¼r "differently abled"? ðŸ˜… statt disabled, handicapped, person of disability, special needs...



Pro Persona ein 1-seitiger "Comic" mit alltÃ¤glichen Situationen! Z.B. Vreni als Grandma Veronica, mit Enkelkindern zusammen, dann mit dem Handy und einem typischen Problem (z.B. Farbkontraste) â†’ auch von einer realen Person einsprechen lassen?!



Generell: Berichte beginnen mit etwas Geschichte, um Emotionen und Verbindung zu wecken:

- First typewriter â†’ Something was created for a disabled person, and the whole world benefits from it now
- Stephen Hawkins â†’ Thanks to the fact that we could include him and enable him, the whole world benefits from his wisdom

Bei Accessibility geht es um Menschen, die du kennst und liebst: deine Mutter (sieht nicht mehr so gut), dein Grossvater (Parkinson), deine Cousine (frisch gebackene Mutter), deinen Nachbarn (Autist mit Social Anxiety), den Verlobten der netten afrikanischen Kellnerin im Bistro gegenÃ¼ber (hat in Tansania ein kleines online Business, aber oft sehr langsames Internet).

Es geht aber auch um DICH als Web-Professional:

- Als Designer:in/UX bewegst du dich von persÃ¶nlichen Vorlieben bez. Ã„sthetik und Nutzer-Interaktion, hin zu klaren, wissenschaftlich fundierten Design-Prinzipien. Diese garantieren eine mÃ¶glichst universelle Nutzung deiner Angebote.
  - Ggf. Folie von AdNovum UX-Typ einblenden, dass nur einige wenige Kriterien der WCAG das visuelle Design betreffen?
  - Accessibility is part of UX! In fact, it is just great UX!
- Als Barrierefreiheits-bewusster Developer orientierst du dich an den universellen, seit Jahrzehnten gÃ¼ltigen HTML-Standards und Konventionen. Dein Code wird dadurch von Mensch und Maschine (SEO) besser verstanden; er wird schlanker, besser lesbar und einfacher wartbar (1x schreiben, 10x Ã¼berarbeiten).
  - Barrierefreiheit kann mit BEM verglichen werden: wenn man es konsequent einsetzt, treten viele potenzielle Probleme komplexer Projekte (bzw. generell in der Zusammenarbeit) deutlich vermindert auf.

Es geht **nicht** darum, KreativitÃ¤t zu beschneiden, sondern darum, Chaos zu vermeiden und Energien zu bÃ¼ndeln.

**Es geht darum:**

- Ausgrenzung zu verhindern (vgl. mit Diskriminierung, Rassismus)
- Menschliches Potenzial zu ergrÃ¼nden (Ã¼ber den Tellerrand hinaus schauen) â†’ First Typewriter, Stephen Hawkins
- Demokratie, um die ErmÃ¤chtigung aller ErdenbÃ¼rger:innen

Carly Fiorina: "Human potential is the only limitless resource we have on this earth."



- "Accessibility is about people, not about standards!" (https://www.stevekurzman.com/accessibility-personas.html)

## Microsoft Inclusive Design

- "Inclusive design is for those who want to make great products for the greatest number of people."
- "But hereâ€™s the problem: If we use our own abilities as a baseline, we make things that are easy for some people to use, but difficult for everyone else."
- "It starts with seeing human diversity as a resource for better designs."
- "If we use our own abilities and biases as a starting point, we end up with products designed for people of a specific gender, age, language ability, tech literacy, and physical ability. Those with specific access to money, time, and a social network."
  - "...this creates the potential to ignore much of the range of humanity."
- "Accessibility defined: 1. The qualities that make an experience open to all. 2. A professional discipline aimed at achieving No. 1."
- "Human beings have amazing capabilities to adapt to different situations, and understanding those adaptations is the key to real **insight**."
- "Are we forced to adapt to technology, or is technology adapting to us?"
- "Empathy is an important part of many different forms of design."

Each persona followed the same formula and format, which includes:

- A name and photo â€“ this was to help make the persona feel more human and additionally, to show that a **disability can also be hidden**.
- A top-level quote â€“ a key point we must remember about this persona.
- Information about their job role, industry, and location â€“ this is to help build a bigger picture of their day-to-day life and the wider context of their needs.
- â€˜Day to day with my disabilityâ€™ section â€“ considerations and challenges they face daily
- Technologies we need to consider.
- A table listing obstacles, ideas on what we can do to help, and further resources.
- A WCAG checklist with links to the relevant sections.
- Some statistics and links to further resources.

A few extra tips:

- Learn to replace the word â€˜userâ€™ with the persona name e.g. how would Ayesha deal with this scenario using a screen reader? Make the names part of your conversations to give them an extra human touch.

Some words regarding "Silver surfers":

- 15y ago, only a minority of people 60+ had touched a computer in their lives, and would not learn it anymore
  - Your audience would not miss too many people by not being accessible
- Today, most people 60+ have worked with computers on a daily basis (many 60+ people use computers)
- In 15y, pretty much all people 60+ will be very tech-savvy (and soon thereafter, the first digital natives will retire)
