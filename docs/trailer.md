- "Creating accessible websites is difficult."
  - At least, that's what most web designers and developers believe.
- But accessibility has become a key requirement in more and more digital projects.
  - So gone are the days where it could simply be ignored.
- Admittedly, the WCAG indeed are quite complex and extensive.
  - And since they are very theory-heavy, it's difficult to put them into practice.
- I, at least, wouldn't want to learn them from scratch, either.




- Hence it's time for a radically different approach to learning accessibility!

  - Hi! I'm Joshua, an accessibility consultant and fullstack developer.

- I learned first hand during my years at the Swiss foundation "Access for all".

  - There I have initiated and authored the ADG and the Swiss Government's Accessibility Checklist 2.1.

- I accompanied dozens of web projects for local and international clients.

  - I figured out how to achieve accessibility in the most simple yet effective ways.
  - And I want to teach those skills to you, dear designers and developers!



- So: welcome to the Accessify Training 2023!
- Over the course of a year I will introduce you to 12 practical virtues
  - For example: Colors and contrasts, keyboard-only operability, forms and validations, and web components
- You will learn the concepts and tools that empower you to assess accessibility on your own!
  - Including the ominous, terrifying (but honestly quite simple and charming) screen reader!
- Life-like personas will make the requirements technically and empathically comprehensible.
  - Ultimately, you will understand why accessibility matters to each and everyone of us
  - And that it benefits both UX and SEO, while improving code readability and performance.



- Each month
  - You will receive a 10mins video, introducing a virtue
  - Followed by several 5min videos, revealing advanced insights and best practices
  - Snackable content, made to fit into your busy workdays!
- Small homework assignments will deepen your experience
  - Apply them to your current projects so you can optimise them on-the-fly!
- At the end of each month
  - You can share experiences and ask questions in our virtual classroom (Zoom)



- This is your chance to finally make friends with accessibility!
- Thanks to deliberate guidance, with minimal effort
  - You will learn how to simply fulfill the majority of WCAG requirements
  - And how to avoid many remaining ones
- After the training, you will be ready to design, implement and validate accessible websites!

**Become an accessibility virtuoso!**

- PrÃ¤misse: Accessibility is complex, ugly, and expensive!
- Video is so much more accessible to 99% of target audience!
  - 99% of web professionals have no disability (and therefore lack awareness about the topic) and thus are used to / capable of watching video tutorials
    - I show you the simplest, most common ways to avoid typical accessibility problems! â†’ doesn't mean they are the sexiest ones (let alone the only ones), but if you choose them you are on the safe side.
      - Keine Spezialbehandlungen! 1 solution that works for as many people as possible!
    - Wird nicht alle auf SpezialfÃ¤lle zutreffen, aber wenigstens wÃ¤ren so zumindest mal die Basics barrierefrei
    - Barrierefreiheit ist nicht etwas "ZusÃ¤tzliches", das "auf ein Produkt draufgemacht" wird, sondern etwas der Technologie InhÃ¤rentes! Barrieren treten dann auf, wenn Technologie einschrÃ¤nkend (oder schlichtweg falsch) eingesetzt wird.
- Sapere aude!
- I don't only teach skills - I teach a mindset, rooted in empathy
- With great power comes great responsibility â†’ not each and every decorative possibility should be used in each and every situation!
- Real science should always involve humility & the willingness to say "It's not about my ego, it's about an issue and we're trying to get to best scientific truth that we can with the methods we have now." (TheHighwire)
- My vocabulary will not always be 100% WCAG compliant, as I'm coming from a developer perspective I will speak in a language that YOU will be able to understand!
  - I'll teach you skills in digital accessibility! There's much more to it, like how to create content inclusively (how to write, etc.), or physical design of devices (ATM height â†’ wheelchair users, sun glare on public screens, etc.), or how an organisation can be more inclusive (i.e. not only telephone or only email support, or not relying on an Intercom at the door â†’ deaf people, etc.)
- Although I give you best practices to avoid most typical a11y problems, you will also learn the TOOLS that you need to evaluate yourself whether something is accessible! This is most and foremost a screen reader! AAAAAAAH!!!
- Viele Anti-Patterns noch vorhanden!
  - Genaues Programmieren! Wie in "HTML 101"! Ordnung halten, Sachen beim Namen nennen. Nicht KreativitÃ¤t verhindern, sondern Chaos!
  - Keine Angst wenn es manchmal auf A11y-Seiten heisst: man muss Dinge mit Sprache und Keyboard steuern kÃ¶nnen! Das hat wenig/nichts mit zusÃ¤tzlichen Features zu tun! Es geht nur darum, HTML korrekt einzusetzen.
- **WCAG 2.2 ready!!** ðŸŽ‰ðŸš€
- Essence of WCAG, without its complexity
  - Map von Utopia aufzeigen (rauszoomen)
  - Beispiel aufzeigen von Tastaturbedienbarkeit
    - Unterschiedlichste WCAG Kriterien damit verknÃ¼pft, ziemlich "random"
      - Das "Pferd von hinten aufzÃ¤umen"
- And: it's always about a few blind people, isn't it?!
- Let's do it differently!
  - 12 virtues
  - Personas
  - You'll get insights (through personas) and see the value of proposed patterns
- For designers and developers! (And quality assurance â†’ testers)
  - Designers need to have a basic understanding of what developers are able to do
  - Developers are not magicians that can simply convert any creative UX idea into a fully working end result!
- No! Accessibility is straight-forward, can be totally appealing (moves aesthetics from personal taste to scientifically based reasoning), and (although there will be some costs in the beginning) will pay back plenty over time - not only due to enlarging your audience (people of disability, SEO ranking), but also due to cleaner, more readable/maintainable ("Leitplanken, vgl. mit BEM") and performant code!





- He is torn between high ideals, high time demands, and lack of reliable, succinct, usable information on Web accessibility. (See Zhang in https://www.w3.org/WAI/redesign/personas)
