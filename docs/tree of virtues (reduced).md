# Accessify.me: 🙏 Virtues and 💡 insights

This document is confidential. Thank you.

1. 🙏 **Offer enough contrast**
   - 💡 **Text needs a contrast of `4.5:1` to its background (or `3:1` for large text).**
   - 💡 **Graphical info needs a contrast of `3:1` to its background.**
   
   - 💡 **Custom color and contrast modes should be supported**
   
2. 🙏 **Serve multiple senses (2-senses principle)**

    1. 💡 **Information conveyed by color should be complemented with shape**
    2. 💡 **Indications should be understandable with different senses**
    3. 💡 **Hiding elements specifically from some channel**
    5. 💡 **Inaccessible media should be accompanied by an accessible alternative**
    5. 💡 **Semantics should be used to mark up content**
3. 🙏 **Describe graphics by text alternatives**

    - 💡 **Informative graphics need an alternative text**
    - 💡 **Complex informative graphics need a longer description**
    - 💡 **Decorative graphics should be ignored by screen readers**
4. 🙏 **Ensure keyboard-only operability**
    - 💡 **Interactive elements should be focusable**
    - 💡 **Interactive elements should be operable via keyboard alone**
    - 💡 **Interactive elements need clearly visible focus states**
    - 💡 **The sequence of interactive elements should be meaningful**
    - 💡 **Interactive elements should be visible**
    - 💡 **States of interactive elements should be distinct**
    - 💡 **Excessive tab stops should be avoidable**
    - 💡 **The keyboard focus should not be overly restricted (trapped)**
    - 💡 **Single letter keyboard shortcuts should be avoidable**
5. 🙏 **Define a coherent page structure and heading hierarchy **

    - 💡 **Landmarks should encompass page areas**
    - 💡 **The page's `<main>` landmark should be structured meaningfully by headings**
    - 💡 **Landmarks with no visible heading should offer visually hidden headings**
    - 💡 **Headings should preside their content**
6. 🙏 **Apply semantics to structure content (HTML 101)**

    - 💡 **Paragraphs should be marked up as `<p>`**
    - 💡 **Lists should be marked up as `<ul>`, `<ol>`, or `<dl>`**
    - 💡 **Quotes should be marked up as `<cite>` or `<blockquote>`**
    - 💡 **Breadcrumbs should be marked up correctly**
    - 💡 **Footnotes should be marked up correctly**
7. 🙏 **Enhance screen reader compatibility**
    - 💡 **Every page needs a unique, self-speaking title**
    - 💡 **Language declarations should be correct**
    - 💡 **Active elements should be declared as `[aria-current]`**
    - 💡 **Expandable elements should be declared as `[aria-expanded]`**
    - 💡 **Link texts should be self-speaking and unique**
    - 💡 **Asynchronous notifications should be marked as `[aria-live]` regions**
8. 🙏 **Provide tabular data as tables**

    - 💡 **Tabular data should be marked up as `<table>`**
    - 💡 **Tables should have `<th>` elements for columns and rows**
    - 💡 **Tables should be careful with `[rowspan]` and `[colspan]`**
    - 💡 **Tables should have a `<caption>`**
    - 💡 **Tables should be responsive**
9. 🙏 **Build robust forms and validations**

    - 💡 **Form inputs should have a `<label>`**
    - 💡 **Form inputs should be implemented using standard controls**
    - 💡 **Groups of inputs should be grouped using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`**
    - 💡 **Non-interactive elements between form controls should be associated with `[aria-describedby]`**
    - 💡 **Required inputs should be marked up with `[required]`**
    - 💡 **Browser-Validations should be used considerately**
    - 💡 **Validation messages should be meaningful and associated to the input**
        
10. 🙏 **Choose accessible components**
    - 💡 **Accordions should behave accessibly**
    - 💡 **Autocompletes should behave accessibly**
    - 💡 **Date pickers should behave accessibly**
    - 💡 **Dialogs should behave accessibly**
    - 💡 **Dropdowns should behave accessibly**
    - 💡 **Carousels should behave accessibly**
    - 💡 **Tabs should behave accessibly**
    - 💡 **Tooltips should behave accessibly**
11. 🙏 **Add audio transcripts and video subtitles**

     - 💡 **Pure audio content should have a text transcript**
     - 💡 **Pure video content should have a text transcript**
     - 💡 **Video with audio should have closed captioning**
12. 🙏 **Build a robust yet flexible experience**
